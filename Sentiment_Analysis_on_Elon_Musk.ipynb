        "\n",
        "A sentiment analysis is the act of computationally recognizing and classifying opinions stated in a text, particularly to ascertain if the writer has a favorable, negative, or neutral viewpoint on a certain subject, item, etc. This will detect any positive, negative, or neutral sentiment in text. For this example, I will be doing Elon Musk. Elon Musk has a been a topic of controversy when he decided to buy twitter and that caused an uprise on Twitter. It got me thinking about doing a sentiment analysis on Elon's Twitter Page to see what his page is like now since he bought Twitter.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Important Note:\n",
        " - You need to have **ELEVATED** Access Twitter Developers account or else you will not be able to gather tweets.\n",
        " - Have a .txt file that will include api key, api secret key, access token, and secret access token. This is needed to pass the verification or else the code will not work.\n",
        " - Each Code block needs to be run in order of the code block you see.\n",
